# Exploring Filters in color segmentation for detection of Duodenal Cysts in Wireless Capsule endoscopy images 
# Abstract
WCE (Wireless Capsule Endoscopy) stands out as a groundbreaking invention, revolutionizing the detection of various digestive
tract diseases in hu-mans. Clinicians leverage WCE to diagnose a range of abnormalities, including polyps, duodenal cysts, 
ulcers, tumors, and intestinal cancer, providing a convenient and effective means of examination. To alleviate the challenges 
faced by physicians, there is a pressing need for an automated and efficient recognition system. This paper introduces an 
advanced method for the automatic detection of duodenal cysts in WCE images, employing the HSV color model. The first step 
involves identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) by applying a threshold to images extracted from WCE videos. In this pursuit, 
the paper harnesses the capabilities of OpenCV, a prominent Python library explicitly designed for tackling challenges in 
Computer Vision. OpenCV proves to be a stalwart in the field, offering a myriad of functionalities, including filtering, 
transforming, resizing, and more. Notably, segmentation emerges as a crucial task achievable through OpenCV, paving the way 
for more advanced concepts such as classification and detection. Segmentation, in essence, involves dividing different objects 
into sections based on shared characteristics, be it object type or color. The proposed method outlined in this paper takes a 
significant step towards enhancing the efficiency and precision of duodenal cyst detection in WCE images
